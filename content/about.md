title: "About Price Theory Palooza"

## What is it?

Price Theory Palooza is a place that celebrates price theory and the economic way of thinking by sharing puzzles and problems.

Like Wordle, but weekly (for now), and instead of practicing the skills to beat your nephew in hangman, you develop the skills to understand the social world.

## Why?

Economics is an art as well as a science. AI *can* answer just about any price theory puzzle thrown its way. It can also tell you which are the greatest classical composers, but what is that to you? You only learn true appreciation from actually listening to sonatas. Likewise, you only learn price theory with practice. Good taste is earned.

Price Theory Palooza is here to help you earn it. 

## How?

See if you can answer the puzzles! Then head over to Substack and join in the discussion. How well did you do?

## Who?

Price Theory Palooza is *for* you: ye who live in a world with other people and want to marvel at the peaceful cooperation of strangers under the division of labor.

This is a project of [Kurtis Hingl](https://kurtishingl.com/), currently a fourth year student and PhD candidate in economics at George Mason University.

I gratefully thank [Tegan Truitt](https://www.tegantruitt.com/about) for having good taste in price theory and sharing editorial suggestions. 

All puzzles include individual citations and links where applicable, though some wording may be adapted.

I thank [Caleb Fuller](https://www.calebsfuller.com/) for permission to use the name "Price Theory Palooza."

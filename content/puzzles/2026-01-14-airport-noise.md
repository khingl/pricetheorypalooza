The town of Mayberry is thinking of expanding its airport. One problem with the expansion is that it would result in more airplane noise. For people who live near the airport, hearing that noise would cause as much unpleasantness as the collective loss of $100,000 every year.

When Mayberry weighs the costs and benefits of its airport expansion, that $100,000 should count as a cost.
